General list of specific things not to forget to do:
---
-Create types of users (Teacher, User, Administrator)
-Create Contact/Feedback page and point to it with header link
-Main blue button on index link
-Add check that user's email is confirmed somewhere either in user.php or at dashboard
-Google recaptcha non robot check at signup
-Add copyright to login and signup pages (or move it into the main page)
-Make sure email isn't already used during sign up
-Chagne email verification confirmation request to /welcome

-Remove DevFiles directory and files from git repo
-Index template requires attribution
-Review SQL for injection security
-Add accept privacy policy on signup (check if nessisary)


Possible ideas
---
-Save format of quotes section for used by collages section in future
-Add section talking about how teachers can use the service
-Add socail network logins
-Save input fields that are correct during signup ex when rejecting rejected ones
-Limit login attempts per email (account)
-Japanese text versions of the pages
-Student can delete their account (save security data for time?)
-Likely switch at least the user dashboard to a custom Angular dashboard if enough design time/money provided

Critical issues
----
-Build password recovery
-Build email account verification
-Write Docs including things like Database, SESSION and other variables
-Block Users from entering /userDashboard when not logged in ($_SESSION var check)

Non critical Bugs
---
-Selecting a saved input such as email in the input in chrome changes the login box to yellow
-Add a remember login check box feature to only temp remember login
-Move font awsome and other external elements onto site server for stability
